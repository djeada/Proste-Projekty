## Requirements

To run this project locally you will need:

* Python 3.8+

No additional libraries or packagaes are needed!

## Installation

1. Download the code from the repository:
    
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/djeada/Proste-Projekty.git
```

2. Navigate to the appropriate directory:

```Bash
cd Proste-Projekty/projekty/python/calculator
```

3. Start the app:

```Bash
python src/main.py
```

## Usage

1. Enter the text to be deciphered or ciphered into the message input.
2. Enter the offset using the key input.
3. Select whether the algorithm should cipher or decipher the message using the mode dropdown.
4. Press the Run button.
5. The processed message appears in the text area. 

## Features

* The ability to define any integer key. 
* Two modes (ciphering and decyphering).

## Possible improvements

Some of the ideas include:

* Implement another alogrithm and allow the user to specify which one should be used.
