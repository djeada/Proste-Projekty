This is a straightforward terminal-based timer program written in C. It displays elapsed time in HH:MM:SS format and updates the time display every second on a single line in the terminal. The program offers a simple, yet effective way of tracking time directly from your command line.

## How to Use
- Compile and run the program; it will start counting time immediately.
- The timer displays the elapsed time in the format: `HH:MM:SS`.
- To stop the timer, simply press `CTRL+C`. The program will display "Timer stopped" and exit.

## Features
- Accurate time tracking in hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Updates the display every second without creating new lines in the terminal.
