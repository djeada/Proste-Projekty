Caesar Cipher

## About the project

This project is a desktop application that utilizes the Caesar cipher algorithm to cipher or decipher text messages.

## Requirements

To run this project locally, you will need:

* Python 3.8+

No additional libraries or packages are needed!

## Installation

1. Clone the code repository from GitHub:

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/djeada/Proste-Projekty.git
```

2. Navigate to the appropriate directory:

```Bash
cd Proste-Projekty/projekty/python/caesar_cipher
```

3. Start the app:

```Bash
python src/main.py
```

## Usage

1. Enter the text to be deciphered or ciphered into the message input.
2. Enter the offset using the key input.
3. Select whether the algorithm should cipher or decipher the message using the mode dropdown.
4. Press the Run button.
5. The processed message appears in the text area.

## Features

* The ability to define any integer key.
* Two modes (ciphering and deciphering).
* A graphical user interface (GUI) for the program.

## Possible improvements

Some ideas for potential improvements include:

* Adding additional options for the Caesar cipher algorithm, such as allowing the user to specify the character set to be used for the cipher.
* Implementing other encryption algorithms, such as the Vigen√®re cipher, Playfair cipher, or Rail Fence cipher, to expand the functionality of the program.
* Adding a feature to save the processed message to a file, or to copy it to the clipboard.
* Adding a feature to automatically detect the key used to encrypt a message, if the key is not known.
* Allowing the user to input a custom key phrase or keyword, instead of a numerical key, for the Caesar cipher.
* Improving the error-handling capabilities of the program, to handle unexpected inputs or edge cases.
